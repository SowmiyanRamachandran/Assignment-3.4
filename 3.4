NameNode :

The NameNode is the centerpiece of an HDFS file system. It keeps the directory tree of all files in the file system, and tracks where across
the cluster the file data is kept. It does not store the data of these files itself.

Client applications talk to the NameNode whenever they wish to locate a file, or when they want to add/copy/move/delete a file.
The NameNode responds the successful requests by returning a list of relevant DataNode servers where the data lives.

Importance-
1.NameNode knows the list of the blocks and its location for any given file in HDFS. With this information NameNode knows how to construct
the file from blocks.
2.NameNode stores the metadata of HDFS â€“ the directory tree of all files in the file system, and tracks the files across the cluster.
